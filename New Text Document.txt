I creating e-commerce for furniture, and now i'm in products page and I want to make an array of objects to store the products in it , and I want to create many functions in this array, first I wanna to do the crud operation functions in this array by the user whose role is admin only, and I want to do a function to add the product which the x user clicked in "add to cart" to a cart related for this user only because I have a cart page and I should display the products added to cart by the current user only , those each user should have his own cart products and also his own wish list .
in user cart, user can delete the product from cart or go to checkout page but when he click in "checkout" button which in his cart page, the product will go to admin with status "pending" and admin will display the products in his page and change the status of the product ("accepted" or "rejected"). after admin replay, I should make a notification for user that admin has accepted (count) of your checkout, product place order now!, and the when he go in checkout page I should display the products its status is "accepted" only to place order it and also display its total amount and some details you know.
I want to make filter in products array by category,
and in user cart array by status.
I want to link between the user and the product he chose wither to cart or to wish list so when i display it in the page, the current user cart and wish list products only display
use export and import method for the arrays and function which will use an many files 
don't forget to create a function to display only latest three products added in the array to display them in landing page.
my project consist of (landing, products, cart, wish list, checkout) pages , and admin dashboard, don't forget to allow admin to make crud operation in the products array, but user do them only in his own cart and wish list arrays. admin can add product but user can't.
I want you to focus in js than html and css, I want a easy logic and basic functions not advanced and explain each function by comment. I'm already have created the user pages but i know you will have to add ids and classes for html element you will use in functions and I don't have problem with this , you can create admin dashboard . thank you
